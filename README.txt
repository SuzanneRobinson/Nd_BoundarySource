Contains the scripts and files used for the implementation of neodymium isotopes in the ocean of FAMOUS/HadCM3 GCM

[143Nd] and [144Nd] isotopes are added as separate isotopes.

Boundary conditions:
1. eNd signature of the continents surrounding the ocean (to be extrapolated out to the continental margins.
2. eNd signature of the seafloor (marine detrital eNd) 

Sources:
Dust flux
Riverine Flux
Boundary Source / Benthic flux

Sinks:
Reversible scavenging
