Contains map of the epsilon Neodymium signature of the continental rock surrounding the ocean.
To be downloaded as:
netCDF (gridded data)
shapefile (vector data)

Units are in eNd where:

eNd = ((143Nd/144Nd sample/ 143Nd/144Nd CHUR)-1)*10^4
where CHUR corresponds to the 'bulk earth' standard value of 0.512638 (Jacobsen and Wasserburg, 1980)


Folders:

1. /discrete_observations

contains Table1.pdf, the discrete observations used to create the map. All data was downloaded and full credit goes to Blanchet (2019)

2. /lithology_original

contains the original digital geological map from MapInfo as used in Jeandel et al. (2007), which can be accessed https://ccgm.org/en/24-maps

3. /lithology_revised

contains the revised lithology file used to constrain the interpolation, where the interior of Greenland and Antarctica have been removed

4. /initial_interpolation

contains the initial nearest neighbour interpolation of the discrete data onto the lithology fields

5. /continental_eNd

contains the final representation of the eNd of the margins, to be downloaded in gridded or vector format
